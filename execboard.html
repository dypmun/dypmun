                    <p>An outdoorsy individual and MUN enthusiast who you'd spot memorising speeches in the middle of traffic congestions. However gawky he may sound, it's just a deceiving cover for his sly ways of making things work his way. That's Taher
                        Penwala in a nutshell.</p>
                    <p>He's a broad minded individual who is always up for deep discussions. An active participant in whatever task it may be, he'd always have his own quirky ways but will make sure get the best out of it.</p>
                    <p>Feel free to ask multiple doubts at any point, as many times as you wish as he's extremely approachable too.
