                    <p>An outdoorsy individual and MUN enthusiast who you'd spot memorising speeches in the middle of traffic congestions. However gawky he may sound, it's just a deceiving cover for his sly ways of making things work his way. That's Taher

                    <p>He's a broad minded individual who is always up for deep discussions. An active participant in whatever task it may be, he'd always have his own quirky ways but will make sure get the best out of it.</p>
                    <p>Feel free to ask multiple doubts at any point, as many times as you wish as he's extremely approachable too.

                    <p>Critical thinking and devising instant jabs are Tisya’s favourite aspects of a MUN. She believes that MUNs shape young students' minds in a way like no other extracurricular activity and compose the youth to be much more aware of the
                        happenings around the world. She is eager to help other delegates in every way she can, and aspires to make students comfortable and master MUN skills.</p>
                    <p>She is looking forward to new and exciting debate-filled adventures with the delegates!</p>
