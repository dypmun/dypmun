                    <p>An outdoorsy individual and MUN enthusiast who you'd spot memorising speeches in the middle of traffic congestions. However gawky he may sound, it's just a deceiving cover for his sly ways of making things work his way. That's Taher

                    <p>Feel free to ask multiple doubts at any point, as many times as you wish as he's extremely approachable too.

                    <p>My name is Harshiv Gajjar and I'll be the vice chair person for UNHRC. I have been munning since I was in grade 6. I am currently studying Bsc Computer Science from Fergusson College Pune. </p>
                    <p>I feel MUNs are more than just platform for competitions, they are tools to realise that every small step can help bring change in the world. Looking forward to working with you all.</p>

                    <p>For the upcoming event, she will put her soul into making you comfortable and appreciated in the debate session. As Caroline Forbes said- “When anybody tells me I can’t do something, I prove them wrong” is exactly what defines Manasi’s
                        passion with everything she does.</p>
                    <p>She will make sure that each and everyone in her committee gets inspired to participate in the debate. not only during conferences but also in life. She will not only make debating seem like a great opportunity, but also as a challenge
                        for those adventurers who want to look at perspectives differently. Manasi aims to shape you into your own role model, and will always be there to hold your hand and walk with you through all your milestones.</p>

                    <p>Critical thinking and devising instant jabs are Tisya’s favourite aspects of a MUN. She believes that MUNs shape young students' minds in a way like no other extracurricular activity and compose the youth to be much more aware of the
                        happenings around the world. She is eager to help other delegates in every way she can, and aspires to make students comfortable and master MUN skills.</p>
