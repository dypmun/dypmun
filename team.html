                    <p>An IBDP Y2 at D.Y. Patil International School, Nerul, Aishi Singh is delighted to serve as DYMUN’s Secretary Generals. Aishi fell in love with the world of Model United Nations at a very young age — as she has always been intrigued
                        by the event’s promotion of discourse, discussion, and debate. It is her belief that MUN is where young minds evolve into our next generation of difference makers, diplomats, and politicians. Over the course of the conference,
                        Aishi hopes that all delegates broaden their horizons about current affairs, improve their public speaking skills, and have an overall rewarding experience participating in the committee sessions.
