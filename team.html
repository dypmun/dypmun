                    <p>An IBDP Y2 at D.Y. Patil International School, Nerul, Aishi Singh is delighted to serve as DYMUN‚Äôs Secretary Generals. Aishi fell in love with the world of Model United Nations at a very young age ‚Äî as she has always been intrigued
                        by the event‚Äôs promotion of discourse, discussion, and debate. It is her belief that MUN is where young minds evolve into our next generation of difference makers, diplomats, and politicians. Over the course of the conference,
                        Aishi hopes that all delegates broaden their horizons about current affairs, improve their public speaking skills, and have an overall rewarding experience participating in the committee sessions. In her free time, you might find
                        Aishi pretending to be a competitive eater (at home), having a laugh with some of his closest friends (over Zoom) or most probably sleeping till noon.
                    </p>
                    <p>Aishi is altogether excited to see this eventful and debate-filled weekend unfold.<br>Please feel free to contact her, should you have any questions! She is looking forward to meeting you in October.</p>

                    <p>These are the words Krisha would choose to describe what being a MUNer encompasses. Having attended many herself, Krisha believes that MUNs are one of those rare and life-changing opportunities that will open your eyes to the world
                        and make you well-versed with grappling issues in the most fun and interactive way possible!</p>
                    <p>Also, while she‚Äôs not MUNing, studying, or rewatching another season of F.R.I.E.N.D.S, Krisha loves to read and dance and play the guitar. She‚Äôs also an avid language learner, currently unravelling the mysteries of the French and Korean
                        languages.

                    <p>A 16 year old with a bubbly personality, Tisya Goel is very excited to be DYMUN‚Äôs first ever Charge D‚Äôaffaires. She did her first MUN in grade 7, and has been chasing that adrenaline rush of a good debate ever since.</p>
                    <p>Critical thinking and devising instant jabs are Tisya‚Äôs favorite aspects of a MUN. She believes that MUN‚Äôs shape young students' minds in a way that no other extracurricular activity can, and makes young minds much more aware of the
                        happenings around the world. She is eager to help other delegates in every way she can, and aspires to make students comfortable with MUNning. You may find Tisya talking to her friends in her free time, but you can always find
                        her reading a book. She is an adventurer at heart and incredibly sarcastic most of the time.</p>

                        talking and standing up not only during conferences but also in life. She will not only make it seem like a great opportunity but as a challenge for those adventurers who want to try out everything and want to look at perspectives
                        differently. Apart from being an active MUNer she has represented her Nation in International level karate several times and also represented her state in various sports. Manasi aims to shape you into your own role model, and will
                        always be there to hold your hand and walk with you through all your milestones. ‚ÄúDon‚Äôt fear to be eccentric in opinion, for every opinion now accepted was once eccentric‚Äù ~ Bertrand Russell.</p>
